<p>All of these systems have some common nonfunctional requirements. The system must be responsive, regardless of the number of connected clients. The impact of unexpected errors must be minimal, instead of affecting the entire system. It’s acceptable if an occasional request fails due to a bug, but it’s a major problem when the entire system becomes completely unavailable. Ideally, the system should never crash or be taken down, not even during a software upgrade. It should always be up and running, providing service to its clients.</p>
